[Resume] (https://leok7v.github.io) | [Contact](mailto:leo.kuznetsov@gmail.com)

I hate writing resume and love writing code (and even debugging it).
I have been writing code for 40+ years.
So I made a treaty with myself and allowed myself to put together simple 
JavaScript client only `.md` to `.html` generating code that allows me to write
the rest of resume in markdown and `vi`.
